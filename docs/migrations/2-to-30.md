# Migrate from SDK 2.x to 3.0

Welcome to the upgrade guide! No doubt you're here to learn about the differences when upgrading SDKs, so let's get right into it.

This SDK upgrade will allow the SDK to communicate with the V2 Onspring Client API and is not compatible with the V1 API. All features in V2.x SDK are available in 3.0, along with new features, just using different methods/objects/namespaces/etc.

## What's New?

- Client changes:
  - `HttpHelper` has been replaced with `OnspringClient` and moved to the root namespace: `Onspring.API.SDK`.
  - Added ability to supply HttpClient instance.
  - Added ability to customize serialization of JSON.
  - Added interface `IOnspringClient` to allow for easier dependency injection/mocking.
  - Errors are no longer raised on an unsuccessful API response.
  - Added ability to created/update/delete list items.
- Request changes:
  - The majority of request objects have been renamed/modified/restructured.
  - Paging request added to allow for paged requests.
- Response changes:
  - All client responses (other than CanConnect/Async) are wrapped in an `ApiResponse` wrapper class.
    - This allows clients to determine how they want to handle any API response, as well as including a response message, if possible.
  - Paged responses added for endpoints that allow retrieval of data.
    - Methods that get data by their identifiers do not include paging, since a specific set of data is requested.
  - Record result values have been consolidated into the `Onspring.API.SDK.Models` namespace.
- New features:
  - Apps
    - Get individual app info.
    - Get a batch of apps.
    - Paging around getting all apps.
  - Fields
    - Get fields by their identifier.
    - Get a batch of fields.
    - Paging around getting all fields for app.
  - Files
    - Get a file's info without actually getting the file.
    - Delete a file.
  - Lists
    - Add/Update list item.
    - Remove list item.
  - Records
    - Create and update record consolidated into `SaveRecordAsync`.
    - Separate method for querying records, with paging.
    - Delete batch of records.
    - Get batch of records.
    - Paging around getting all records for app.
  - Reports
    - Paging around getting all reports for app.
- Support for netstandard2.1
- Removed all synchronous API calls.

## API Compatibility

Version 3.x of the SDK will not work with the V1 API, due to request/response object changes.

## API address Change

With the V2 Client API, we've approached versioning using header values, which means we're going to need to change the legacy path, as it includes version as part of the path. Specifically, we just need to remove the `v1` portion of the original URL.

- `https://api.onspring.com/v1` should be changed to `https://api.onspring.com/`

## Breaking changes

Due to the amount of breaking changes within the SDK itself, this section will be split up based on the underlying resource.

### App breaking changes

`GetAppsAsync` response object has changed from `IReadOnlyList<App>` to `ApiResponse<GetPagedAppsResponse>`

- Additionally, we've added an optional parameter to the request for paging.

### Field breaking changes

`GetAppFieldsAsync` has been replaced with `GetFieldsForAppAsync`.

- Response type changed from `IReadOnlyList<Field>` to `ApiResponse<GetPagedFieldsResponse>`
- Additionally, the request/response has changed to allow for paging.

```C#
const int appId = 1;

// Old
var fields = await httpHelper.GetAppFieldsAsync(appId);

// New
var getFieldsResponse = await onspringClient.GetFieldsForAppAsync(appId);
var fields = getFieldsResponse.Value.Items;
```

`GetAppFieldAsync` has been replaced with `GetFieldAsync`

- Response type changed from `Field` to `ApiResponse<Field>`

```C#
const int fieldId = 1;

// Old
var field = await httpHelper.GetAppFieldAsync(fieldId);

// New
var getFieldResponse = await onspringClient.GetFieldAsync(fieldId);
var field = getFieldsResponse.Value;
```

### File breaking changes

`GetFileFromRecordAsync` has been replaced with `GetFileAsync`.

- AppId is no longer needed in order to get a file.
- Response type changed from `FileResult` to `ApiResponse<GetFileResponse>`.

```C#
const int appId = 1;
const int recordId = 1;
const int fieldId = 1;
const int fileId = 1;

// Old
var fileResult = await httpHelper.GetFileFromRecordAsync(appId, recordId, fieldId, fileId);

// New
var getFileResponse = await onspringClient.GetFileAsync(recordId, fieldId, fileId);
var fileResult = getFileResponse.Value;
```

`AddFileToRecordAsync` has been replaced with `SaveFileAsync`.

- Overload to load from file has been removed.
- AppId is no longer needed in order to save a file.
- Response type changed from `FileResult` to `ApiResponse<GetFileResponse>`.

```C#
const int appId = 1;
const int recordId = 1;
const int fieldId = 1;
const int fileId = 1;
Stream fileStream = Stream.Null;
const string fileName = "test.png";
const string contentType = "image/png";

// Old
var saveResult = await httpHelper.AddFileToRecordAsync(appId, recordId, fieldId, fileId, fileStream, fileName, contentType);

// New
var saveRequest = new SaveFileRequest
{
    //...
};
var saveResponse = await onspringClient.SaveFileAsync(saveRequest);
var newFileId = saveResponse.Value.Id;
```

### Record breaking changes

`CreateAppRecordAsync` and `UpdateAppRecordAsync` have been replaced with `SaveRecordAsync`.

- Response type changed from `AddEditResult` to `ApiResponse<SaveRecordResponse>`

```C#
const int appId;
var fieldValues = new FieldAddEditContainer();

// Old
var createResponse = await httpHelper.CreateAppRecordAsync(appId, fieldValues);
var updateResponse = await httpHelper.UpdateAppRecordAsync(appId, recordId, fieldValues);

// New
var saveRequest = new SaveRecordRequest
{
    // ...
};
var saveResponse = await onspringClient.SaveRecordAsync(saveRequest);
```

`GetAppRecordsAsync` has been replaced with `GetRecordsForAppAsync`.

- Response type changed from `IReadOnlyList<ResultRecord>` to `ApiResponse<GetPagedRecordsResponse>`.
- Additionally, the request/response has changed to allow for paging.

```C#
const int appId = 1;
const int recordId = 1;
const int fieldId = 1;
const int fileId = 1;
Stream fileStream = Stream.Null;
const string fileName = "test.png";
const string contentType = "image/png";

// Old
var saveResult = await httpHelper.AddFileToRecordAsync(appId, recordId, fieldId, fileId, fileStream, fileName, contentType);

// New
var saveRequest = new SaveFileRequest
{
    //...
};
var saveResponse = await onspringClient.SaveFileAsync(saveRequest);
var newFileId = saveResponse.Value.Id;
```

`GetAppRecordAsync` has been replaced with `GetRecordAsync`.

- Request parameters changed to use an object instead of multiple parameters.
- Response type changed from `ResultRecord` to `ApiResponse<ResultRecord>`.

```C#
const int appId = 1;
const int recordId = 1;

// Old
var record = await httpHelper.GetAppRecordAsync(appId, recordId);

// New
var getRequest = new GetRecordRequest(appId, recordId);
var getResponse = await onspringClient.GetRecordAsync(saveRequest);
var record = getResponse.Value;
```

`DeleteAppRecordAsync` has been replaced with `DeleteRecordAsync`.

- Response type changed from `DeleteResult` to `ApiResponse`.

```C#
const int appId = 1;
const int recordId = 1;

// Old
var deleteResponse = await httpHelper.DeleteAppRecordAsync(appId, recordId);

// New
var deleteResponse = await onspringClient.DeleteRecordAsync(saveRequest);
```

Lastly, the `As` methods for record field values no longer work as properties. In order to cast a RecordFieldValue object to (for example) as string, the change would be to add parens.

`recordField.AsString` has been replaced with `recordField.AsString()` (equally for all `As` methods).

### Report breaking changes

`GetAppReportsAsync` has been replaced with `GetReportsForAppAsync`.

- Response changed from `IReadOnlyList<Report>` to `ApiResponse<GetReportsForAppResponse>`
- Additionally, the request/response has changed to allow for paging.

```C#
const int appId = 1;

// Old
var reports = await httpHelper.GetAppReportsAsync(appId);

// New
var getReportsResponse = await onspringClient.GetReportsForAppAsync(appId);
var reports = getFieldsResponse.Value.Items;
```

`GetReportDataAsync` has been replaced with `GetReportAsync`.

- Response type changed from `ReportData` to `ApiResponse<ReportData>`

```C#
const int reportId = 1;
DataFormat dataFormat = DataFormat.Formatted;
ReportDataType dataType = ReportDataType.ChartData;

// Old
var reportData = await httpHelper.GetReportDataAsync(reportId, dataType, dataFormat);

// New
var getReportResponse = await onspringClient.GetReportAsync(reportId, dataType, dataFormat);
var reportData = getReportResponse.Value;
```
